I have a bit of OCD so I like to make lists for 
- To-dos for the day
- Notes for work
- Post-its so I can make more lists

Sometimes when I need to do lists in a certain order (this is half my day), I have to make numbered lists
1. Prioritize your life
2. Sleep
3. Take care of my plants https://unsplash.com/photos/_6rR_iP06p4 - automatic ![Image of Plant](https://unsplash.com/photos/_6rR_iP06p4)
4. Take a stroll around the block for 20 mins.
